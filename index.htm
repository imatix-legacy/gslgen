<P>GSLgen is a general-purpose file generator.  It generates source code,
data, or other files from an XML file and a schema file.  The XML file
defines a particular set of data.  The schema file tells GSLgen what to
do with that data.

<P>GSLgen is based on two powerful concepts.  First, we use XML to describe
data objects.  XML is a modern, clean, and self-describing data description
language.  Second, we use a general-purpose schema language (GSL) that can
be used to do all kinds of manipulation of the XML data and the resulting
output.  XML + GSL is a strong, yet simple, solution to a problem that is so
common that most people don't even realise it exists: producing source code
and other text output mechanically, from a set of standard templates
(schemas) and object definitions.

<P>The concept of schema-based code generation is extremely powerful and
valuable to those who are capable of abstracting a problem.  These are some
of the things you can do with GSLgen:
<UL>
<LI>Generate interfaces between programs.  Typically, you define the
interface objects as XML, then generate code to pack and unpack these
objects.  You can use GSLgen to create an ad-hoc generator which will
produce code in any language.  This is excellent for passing data between
components written in different languages, and running on different systems.
<LI>Generate programs to access a database.  We do this a lot: it's enough
to define the table we want to work with, then we can generate subroutines
to work with that table, SQL scripts to create and maintain it, etc.  This
is an excellent way to build applications that are portable to any
relational database.
<LI>Generate HTML or other representations of data objects.
<LI>Converting data between formats.  For instance, it's quite common to
convert an XML file in one format to another.  GSLgen can handle this kind
of problem easily.
</UL>

<P>GSLgen is a portable command-line tool that you can easily integrate
into scripts and other tools.  GSLgen also comes as a module that you can
integrate into your own tools.  This is an excellent way to build
XML-processing tools and code generators.

<P>iMatix Corporation has released GSLgen as Open Source, so that you can
benefit from the power of this tool in your own applications.  Prebuilt
installation packages are provided for Windows, Linux, and OS/2.  You can
also build GSLgen from the source code provided.

<P>To use GSLgen, you should be comfortable with the basic concepts of
the Extensible Markup Language (XML).

<P>To use GSLgen, you may download and build the package from the
<A HREF="//imatix-legacy.github.com/gslgen/pub/gslsrc20.zip">source kit</A>.  You will need to
download the SFL library from imatix.com as well.

<P>There is also an <A HREF="//imatix-legacy.github.com/gslgen/pub/gslbin20.zip">executable
available for Windows.</a>

<P>To build GSLgen from the full source kit, download the SFL package,
build that, and then run the 'build' command in the gslgen src directory.
This creates the gslgen executable and libgsl library for linking with your
applications.

<P>For more information see the <A HREF="gsldoc.htm">GSLgen Documentation</A>.

<P>If you have questions about using GSLgen, problem reports, or feature
requests, please mail gslgen@imatix.com.
